# Resilient Lightweight Custom Threat Service

This package implements the Custom Threat Service API, providing a
simple framework to develop threat source lookups in Python using the
Resilient Circuits integration framework.
  
It's suitable for simple "lightweight" threat source lookups.
For more robust and advanced features, you should consider deploying
a standalone threat source, for example based on the Django example
(https://github.com/Co3Systems/co3-api/tree/master/python/examples/custom-threat-service).
